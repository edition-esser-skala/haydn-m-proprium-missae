  – & – & MH 810 represents an alternative version of MH 363:
          The work has been extended by four bars (1–2 and 21–22)
          containing \textit{Alleluia} exclamations. In addition,
          horns have been replaced by trumpets which have been newly composed.
          In the remaining, voices, minor differences to MH 363 occur in bars
          11~(vl~2, 11th~\sixteenthNote),
          18~(vl, 8th~\sixteenthNote; org, 1st~\eighthNote),
          37~(A, 3rd to 5th~\eighthNote),
          48~(vl~1, 4th~\sixteenthNote),
          49~(org, 2nd~\quarterNote), and
          51~(A, 15th~\sixteenthNote). \\
