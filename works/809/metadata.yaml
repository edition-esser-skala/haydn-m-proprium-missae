  –  & –   & \A1 is a setting of the psalm \textit{Dixit Dominus}.
             By contrast, \B1 and \D1 contain five vesper movements.
             Most likely, the original psalm setting was arranged to a vesper
             by Johann Wittmann of the Lambach abbey. This is corroborated
             by the title page of \D1 (“[…] Ex Michaelis Haydn unico Psalmo: |
             Dixit Dominus traductae, et transformatae | per D. Joannem
             Wittmann, Musicum Lamba- | censem”). \D2 contains an additional
             setting of \textit{Laudate Dominum} by Luigi Gatti.
             Overall differences between \A1 and the remaining sources
             are described below. Generally, vocal parts have been
             considerably modified to accomodate the different lyrics. \\
